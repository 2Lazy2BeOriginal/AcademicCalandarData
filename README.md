This repository displays some interesting facts about the similarities and differences between the course codes departments use. Each class has a department prefix (such as BIOL for biology classes and FMLY for family studies) as well as a 4 digit code. The pattern is seemingly random but there are some patterns on what number each department chooses to use.
